## Project Overview
We are building an open-source bot on Rasa that allows users to create their services, perform financial transactions, access lifestyle information, manage e-commerce operations, and engage with intelligent, humorous interactions. The bot will be built using microservices, with MongoDB as the preferred database and Docker for containerization. We will use GitHub for version control.

**Step-by-Step Development Plan**
1. Environment Setup
Set up Docker for containerization: We'll create Docker containers for Rasa, MongoDB, and any other services.
Create a GitHub repository: Initialize a GitHub repo for the project where all code and documentation will be stored.
Create a base Rasa project: Initialize the Rasa bot, set up the project structure, and integrate Docker.
2. User Authentication and Role Management
Implement JWT-based authentication: Set up user authentication using JWT, allowing login and role-based access control (Customer, Service Provider, Admin, Super Admin).
Predefine user roles and permissions: Define permissions for each role within the bot.
Implement additional features: Include features like Forgot Password and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for enhanced security.
3. Financial Transactions
Integrate with payment gateways: Implement APIs for Paystack, Flutterwave, and a custom payment API to allow users to load wallets, pay bills, and perform transactions.
Build wallet management features: Allow users to manage their wallets, check balances, and view transaction history.
Implement security measures: Ensure that all financial transactions are secure, with encryption and PCI-DSS compliance.
4. Lifestyle Features
Integrate with 10 important lifestyle APIs: Fetch and display information such as weather, news, exchange rates, reminders, sports scores, public holidays, health tips, stock prices, horoscope, and traffic updates.
Implement user-specific reminders and alerts: Allow users to set and receive reminders or alerts for important events or information.
5. E-Commerce Functionality
Integrate with existing e-commerce platforms: Set up integrations with platforms like Shopify or WooCommerce to pull in product data, manage orders, and track inventory.
Build a custom order management system: Create a system where users can order food, groceries, etc., with real-time tracking, notifications, and customer reviews.
Develop notification and tracking features: Implement push notifications and tracking for order status, delivery updates, and feedback collection.
6. Intelligence and Humor
Integrate with GPT-4: Use GPT-4 to handle complex queries, generate jokes, and provide intelligent responses.
Predefine humor responses: Create a set of predefined responses for jokes, trivia, and general entertainment.
Implement advanced requests: Allow advanced users to make specific requests like making phone calls or setting up complex reminders.
7. Microservices Architecture
Modularize components into microservices: Separate the bot's functionalities into different microservices for authentication, financial transactions, lifestyle services, e-commerce, and intelligence.
Implement inter-service communication: Use message queues or API calls for communication between microservices.
Deploy using Docker Compose: Manage the deployment of microservices using Docker Compose for easy scaling and maintenance.
8. Testing and Deployment
Write unit and integration tests: Ensure each component is thoroughly tested with unit and integration tests.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate testing, building, and deployment.
Deploy on a cloud platform: Use AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for deploying the bot, ensuring scalability and reliability.
